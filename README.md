# Winver-Modded
Windows Version applet reporter, now in a new style and fluent!

# What is this, didn't you make another one like this?
Well of course i did but those themes and modifications are terrible in quality, i can assure you this new version is much better and the old one will be deprecated.

# Regarding windows 11 and windows 10
the themes on windows 10 might look a bit weird but this is due to the program being designed for windows11 and windows 10 support is being worked on.

# Last but not the least, this is a fork!
Yes i forked this from rounk-ctrl's winver for the rectify11 project, and i modded it, all credits go to him and this is completely free and open source software!
